  <p class="bold">Dr. Sameh Badie</p><img src="../img/Badie.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img">
  <p class="body">Dr. Sameh Badie is a professor at the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at the George Washington University (GWU). Dr. Badie joined George Washington University in 2001. Dr. Badie has more than 30 years of experience in research and academia in the field of structural engineering.</p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Badie received his bachelor and master degrees in structural engineering with high honors from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. He received his Ph.D. degree in civil engineering, with a major in structural engineering, from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in 1997. </p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Badie has long and successful history with research projects related to use of precast concrete deck panel systems on highway bridges. He is the principal investigator (PI) of NCHRP 12-65 and NCHRP 12-96, and a co-principal investigator (Co-PI) of NCHRP 12-41 and NCHRP 18-14, sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program of the Transportation Research Board (TRB). Many of the products developed in his research projects have been implemented on highway bridges in North America, including the NUDECK deck panel system, the hidden-pocket deck panel systems, and the large-size steel studs. Dr. Badie’s research on composite beam/slab systems lead to a major change in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specification, where the shear connector spacing was increased from 24 inches to 48 inches. His recent research in NCHRP 12-96 has revealed that the spacing can be extended to 72 inches, while maintaining full composite action. </p> 
  <p class="body">Dr. Badie is the recipient of the Martin P. Korn Award, Young Educator Award, Leslie D Martin Award of Merit Award, and Certificate of Special Merit from the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI), the Charles Pankow Award for Innovation from the Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF), the ACI Structural Engineering Award from the American Concrete Institute (ACI), and the Outstanding Teacher Award from the George Washington University.</p>
  <p class="body">Dr. Badie is a co-author of the PCI State-of-the-Art Report on Full-depth Precast Concrete Bridge Deck Panels, and the 1st and 2nd editions of the PCI Bridge Design Manual. Dr. Badie is a co-author of many webinars sponsored by PCI and FHWA on use of precast concrete deck panel systems on highway bridges. Dr. Badie is a registered professional engineer in Maryland, Nebraska and Virginia. </p>

 <p class="bold">Dr. Jalel Azaiez</p> <img src="../img/Azaiez.jpg" width="170" align="right" class="keynote-img"> 
 <p class="body">Jalel Azaiez is currently a Professor at the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering in the University of Calgary (Canada). He is also Associate Dean in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. He holds a Dilôme d’Ingénieur from the Ecole Centrale de Paris (France) and a M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Stanford University (U.S.A.) both in Chemical Engineering. 
His recent research focuses on modelling fluid flow instabilities and in particular those involving complex flows in porous media. These include non-isothermal flows with or without chemical reactions, involving Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with a particular focus on nanofluids in micro-geometries. His research team has developed a number of software and mathematical algorithms to analyze flow instabilities under a wide variety of conditions that have applications in the fields of oil recovery, soil remediation and materials processing. He holds a number of awards on his research and teaching accomplishments. He serves on the editorial board of three Journals and has presented invited talks and seminars in numerous worldwide forums (Belgium, France, Japan, USA, etc.).</p>
